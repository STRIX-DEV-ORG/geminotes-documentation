    Wonderful notes extension. Pops up easily, does not ask for stupid permissions like 50% of extensions on the store, and just works very well.

  - **Roberto Ciccolella**  
    I am a web developer and often I need to paste some snippets of code to re use on the project I am working on, to use a full featured app like Google Docs or Evernote was overkill and not that convenient since you have to wait the app to load etc. Sticky Notes is a joy to use because it is super fast. Brilliant!
